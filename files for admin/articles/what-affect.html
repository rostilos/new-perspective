          Imagine the situation. You've asked developers to speed up the
          download of the online store. They offered to do it just in three
          months thanks to the new PWA (Progressive Web App) technology. They
          promised to load up to 1.5 seconds and a reasonable development
          budget. Unfortunately, in practice, it's not that close to reality. We
          see several significant problems related to the novelty of the
          technology. We want to tell more about them honestly, from the
          experience we have already had.

      <h4 class="article__title">FYI. What is PWA</h4>
      <p class="article__text">
        Today, more than 70% of e-commerce web traffic is on mobile devices. A
        progressive web application's created especially for «mobile» clients.
        It combines the functions of the site and the native application. What
        does PWA mean to a user? It can open a site in a mobile browser and save
        it as an application on a phone, bypassing Google App or the App Store.
        The user may not even install it. In any case, the site would look like
        an application, opening all over the screen. Also, your site gets extra
        perks such as the ability to send push notifications and work without
        access to the Internet.
      </p>
      <div class="article__text article__text--border-left">
        <h4 class="article__title-bold">Problem #1</h4>
        <p>
          It is likely that the user will not install the site as an
          application. According to a recent survey in the United States, 88
          percent of those surveyed are willing to download up to 38 apps, and
          only 10 percent are willing to see more icons on their phone. Yes, in
          the case of re-orders of sushi, mail services or shopping on the
          market place, there is a high probability that the application will.
          But in other cases, no.

        <h4 class="article__title-bold">Problem #2</h4>
        <p>
          PWA sites are not downloaded in 1-1.5 seconds. But speed is the main
          profit that the client expects to receive. Practice shows that on PWA
          there is no expected 1.5 seconds to boot. Why does this happen? On
          pure demo projects, a simple function is usually used. Sites for
          medium and large businesses always require additional. That’s what
          slows down the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the customer wants the page load tracker to show no more than 1.5
          seconds. As a result, the developers are forced to play tricks - many
          data are played using ajax. This means that important blocks (menus,
          pictures of goods, name, price) - appear immediately on the download
          page, and others later. You can win a fraction of a second. But
          somehow the complex functionality of a site correlates with its
          download speed always.

        <h4 class="article__title-bold">Problem #3</h4>
        <p>
          Making the site on PWA longer and more expensive than many people
          think. Our experience shows, the development on PWA is three times
          longer than on traditional Magento. The reason is the novelty of
          technology itself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="article__text">
        There is a basic PWA function. It is suitable for small businesses. Most
        likely there is no need for small businesses to move on PWA, since this
        technology's expensive. Large businesses, in turn, have a need for a
        broad functionality that is not yet developed for PWA. Additional
        features are customized development. And customized development on PWA
        takes a lot of time and money.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        For example, in a "box" of PWA, there is no possibility to use the
        special price for a product. It seems to be the basic thing for a box,
        but there's no option to use it. There are no bundle products in the
        box. For example, a bed and two bedside tables are cheaper to buy
        together, but you can buy them separately. As a result, we developed
        these functions specifically for the customer.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        The good news is that PWA is updated regularly. We have been developing
        a website for Tefal for six months and updated the product three times.
        For example, in the beginning, the PWA development on Magento did not
        support the comparison page, but now it does.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        Sometimes the timing is also affected by the specifics of the PWA
        application updates. The PWA sites are not updated by the F5 click. The
        developer needs to write a special feature that checks if there are any
        updates on the server. If there are any, it initiates an application
        update. For developers, it’s an extra layer of work. For example, if an
        application works offline, it is necessary to check whether prices and
        availability of goods have changed from time to time. Or don’t keep this
        data offline and upload it in real-time from the server. You need to
        understand which data needs to be updated more often and which data less
        frequently.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        There is a lot of customized work on PWA. We see this in our projects
        and hear from different customers who've already worked with PWA. Let’s
        say that your online store has a special offer for the new iPhone
        release and it is necessary to make a special promotional page
        immediately. If it is a regular Magento, it will take a day or two to
        implement. However, it won't be possible to do it that quickly on PWA
        since there's more technology involved in development.
      </p>
      <h4 class="article__title">Conclusions</h4>
      <p class="article__text">
        Let's sum up. Someone can ask why move to PWA, if it requires such a
        cost, a lot of caste development and still does not download in 1.5
        seconds? Maybe it's better to optimize a simple Magento then?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4 class="article__title-bold">
            First of all, PWA will speed up the site work.
          </h4>
          <p class="article__text">
            It is guaranteed. To win a second, or even a fraction of a second is
            what the modern world is fighting for every single day. Speed is
            very important for customer experience and as a consequence
            conversion. PWA is close to native technologies, lifts information
            from the user’s phone, like location, name, surname. The application
            can take this data so that the user only partially completes the
            checkout. As a result, there's the possibility to order in one click
            or even without an internet connection.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="article__title-bold">
            Secondly, PWA is a headless architecture.
          </h4>
          <p class="article__text">
            The independent work of frontend and backend allows to carry out
            technical works on the site more painless. You can even replace a
            backend engine, and users won’t feel the substitution.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="article__title-bold">
            Thirdly, the specificity of PWA updates is that, unlike native
            applications, there is no need to coordinate with Google Play or
            Apple Store.
          </h4>
          <p class="article__text">
            With a typical mobile application, you need to pass a Google Play or
            Apple Store technical test to run the upgrade. It takes days, or
            even weeks, to get this right. Plus, they often return the update
            back for work.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="article__text">
        And our main conclusion is that by skipping new technology today, it’s
        harder to catch up further. Often business representatives think that
        they can save on technology and later «upgrade» it. Experience shows
        that if you don’t implement it first, you end up spending half as much
        time on development. We wish you not to waste time and work as
        efficiently as possible!
