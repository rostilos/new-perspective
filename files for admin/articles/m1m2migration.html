          In the summer of 2020, Adobe stopped supporting Magento 1. It means that the modules and extensions have
          ceased to be updated, and development for the M1 has become custom. This is accompanied by:

      <p class="article__text">
        Let’s imagine that the e-commerce project is 5-7 years old. As a rule, it started with one team of developers.
        Then there are several contractor changes. Often, such a project does not have documentation. Thus, it takes up
        to 3-4 months to understand and put the existing functionality in order. This information has been layered for
        years. Apart from it, there's custom functionality, which has been added many times. The list of modified and
        customized functionality does not exist. His audit might take a while.

      <p class="article__text">
        As a result, the magento developer is dedicated to the website audit of the week, but this does not help to
        realize all the optimization tasks. Even installing a new version of PHP 7.2, which is also possible on the M1
        platform, does not solve the problem. The broken functions need to be replaced. In our recent experience, it
        took more than 50 hours on one of the major e-commerce projects and 80 hours on the other.

        Switching to the new M2 platform is an opportunity to redesign the functionality and refactor the code. Over the
        years, new business requirements have emerged. Migration allows you to adapt the project to today’s realities,

        simplifies their updating in the future. There is also a more «usable» administrative panel. Even an
        inexperienced user can manage an online store with an easy-to-understand interface. Another advantage of Magento
