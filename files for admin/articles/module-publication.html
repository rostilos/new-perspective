      <p class="article__text">
        Within this case, Perspective Studio team worked with an unusual client.
        As a rule, we are module developers for companies with online shops at
        Magento. In this case, the client's business builts on the referral
        system basis, which means they're looking for partners who help in the
        sales of goods by placing links to the sites.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        At the same time, the company cooperates with various ecommerce systems,
        including Magento. We have developed a referral system module for
        Magento 1 and Magento 2. The module tracks the buyer's behaviour: the
        transition to the site and further actions on the order registration.
        The purpose of such a module is to collect data about buyers who visited
        this site by the referral link.
      </p>

      <h4 class="article__title">Terms of development</h4>
      <p class="article__text">
        Development lasted two months. Initially estimated the task at 60-80
        hours. The duration of development was influenced by the peculiarities
        of the technical task and changes to it within the work process. There
        is well-known research by Steve McConel, that the later the client makes
        changes to the initial technical task during development, the more money
        and time he needs for implementation. Therefore, we recommend this
        legislation be presented to the client before the start of work.
      </p>

      <h4 class="article__title">Development stages</h4>
      <p class="article__text">
        The publication of the module at the Magento Marketplace provides two
        types of reviews: technical and marketing. Development is carried out in
        accordance with the standards and requirements of Magento. Development
        consists of several stages:

              Technical Review Guidelines
            </a>
            should be followed during the development of the module. These
            guidelines are mandatory for extensions published on the Marketplace
            since code style will be automatically checked through Code Sniffer.
            We recommend configuring PHP_CodeSniffer and using Magento Coding
            Standard.
          </p>

          <h4 class="article__title">Composer.json</h4>
          <p>
            The module must contain a valid composer.json file with all required
            dependencies. The composer.json file specifies:
          </p>
          <ul class="article__list">
            <li class="font-regular">name</li>
            <li class="font-regular">type</li>
            <li class="font-regular">version</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The composer.json does not declare:</p>
          <ul class="article__list">
            <li class="font-regular">extra.map</li>
            <li class="font-regular">extra.magento-root-dir</li>
            <li class="font-regular">
              restrict versions of PHP that do not meet the Magento restrictions
            </li>
            <li class="font-regular">
              does not declare dependence on:

              <ul class="_list-lettered">
                <li class="font-regular">
                  magento/magento-composer-instроaller
                </li>
                <li class="font-regular">magento/magento2-base</li>
                <li class="font-regular">magento/product-community-edition</li>
                <li class="font-regular">magento/magento2-ee-base</li>
                <li class="font-regular">magento/product-enterprise-edition</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li class="font-regular">does not use * as a dependency version</li>
            <li class="font-regular">require inline alias</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We also recommend you validate composer.json by installing your
            extension on your local project. Simply install an additional
            repository with path to the repository directory of the
            <a
              href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path"

            module.
          </p>

          <p>Unit Tests</p>

          <p>
            If you decide to publish your extension to the Magento Marketplace,
            it is time to start writing the unit tests. Despite the fact that
            there are no direct requirements for the number of tests, it is
            recommended to cover with unit tests from 60% to 80% of your code.
            You can usually write tests after the main code, but this is a good
            time to try.
          </p>

          <div class="article__text article__text--border-left">
            <p>Additional</p>
            <p>
              During module development, it is crucial to find vulnerable
              places. Malware Scan checks the extension, all media files and
              documents for malicious code or links. All code and marketing
              content submitted to the Magento Marketplace is also checked to be
              unique and not duplicated code from an already known extension.
              The module must be installed without errors on the specified
              versions of Magento and run without errors in production mode with
              the Varnish Cache enabled. Autotests check if store pages get into
              the cache and come back from the Varnish Cache.

            Pay enough attention to the long Description form of your module.
            Explain what the module can do for a merchant and how it works. List
            key features. Describe what changes can be made in the interface or
            UX of the site, or can be made to the settings. You can give
            examples of cases when merchant can use the module. Leave a clear

            your extension.
