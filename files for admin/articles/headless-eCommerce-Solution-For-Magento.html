        This saves time and resources and ensures the website remains competitive and up-to-date.

        Let's compare <b class="font-bold">React JS</b> and <b class="font-bold">Vue Storefront</b>. Developing with React JS may cost slightly more than with Vue Storefront because it requires developers to be proficient in a specific syntax.

        The most cost-effective development solution will vary based on the project's unique needs and requirements and the development team's expertise. It's crucial to consider all factors affecting development costs and select a solution that suits the project's requirements and budget.

        Speed of scripts
      </h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px" class="article__text _text-article--sm">
        Speed execution directly impacts the performance of the website or application. Slow script speed can lead to slower page load times, negatively impacting the user experience and ultimately losing customers. In addition, search engines like Google take website performance into account when determining search rankings. A slow website with poor performance can lower search engine rankings, making it harder for potential customers to find your website.

        It's important to note that the speed of scripts can also depend on the specific implementation and configuration of the platform, as well as factors such as server hardware and network conditions. Therefore, it's recommended to test and benchmark the performance of the chosen platform in a real-world scenario before making a final decision.

        Customization
      </h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px" class="article__text _text-article--sm">
        Every business has unique requirements and workflows, and the ability to customize extensions helps ensure the platform can handle those requirements. This customization could include adding or modifying new features to align with specific business processes.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 16px" class="article__text _text-article--sm">
        Having the flexibility to customize extensions can also help businesses avoid vendor lock-in. If a platform doesn't provide the customization options needed, businesses may have to rely on third-party solutions or workarounds, which can be time-consuming and expensive.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text _text-article--sm">
        If your business requires a complex and unique solution,  <b class="font-bold">React JS</b> may be the best choice as it offers more possibilities for expansion and customization. While other solutions may provide more pre-built features, they may not be sufficient for more intricate projects that require comprehensive customization. With React JS, developers can create a solution tailored to the business's needs, ensuring optimal performance and functionality.
