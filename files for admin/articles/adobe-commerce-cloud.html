            It is about cloud infrastructure. This Adobe product is a comprehensive business solution with built-in
            Amazon Web Services hosting. Experts predict that cloud hosting is the future of hosting web-companies. The
            average annual growth rate will be 18,3%. Large-scale business is increasingly choosing cloud services in
            contrast to local hosting. Amazon Web Services ranks second place in the world among other cloud services.

            Adobe Commerce Cloud includes a lot of utilities that will improve business performance: Redis cache for
            faster page loading, RabbitMQ, an application that loads the queue system. In other words, the operations
            e.g saving, updating and adding orders will not overload your site. It will work without problems. Cloud
            infrastructure uses a Fastly service to cache sites pages, resources, a CSS, or in order to protect site and
            network from harmful traffic and attacks. It is also possible to use New Relic service to view and analyze
            data.

            Unlike Adobe Commerce, the Adobe Commerce Cloud platform provides round-the-clock real-time support from the
            Adobe team. This support is covered by a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Thus, if there is a problem with the
            project at night, Adobe support will ensure its smooth, uninterrupted operation.

        The most prior thing business owners are concerned at upgrading terms. The terms depend on the current Magento
        version along with the version the developer wants to upgrade the site. Of course, it is better to upgrade it
        regularly. Then the whole functionality will be easier and faster to update. It also takes into account the
        volume of custome development that needs updating.

        First, you have to install the project locally with all the latest changes to the production environment.

      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        First, you have to install the project locally with all the latest changes to the production environment. If the
        project has multiple websites or pages, it is better to expand all of them to understand the site structure
        better. It is crutial to see how a site works before upgrading. Only then start the upgrading process.

        You need to update the magento/magento-cloud-metapackage. It is specified in the project root in the
        composer.json file. A good solution is to change the dependencies in composer.json according to the Magento
        version you planned upgrade to. You can find the versions that have been released on
        <a href="https://github.com/" class="_text-article _text-article--sm _text-article--orange">GitHub.</a> Then, if
        you are using composer 2, you must run the composer update command.

        Next, we go to edit custom modules that are in the app/code directory. After the update, you should check
        whether frontend works or the custome modules "broke" the site. It includes:

        Additionally, we recommend checking the theme files from app/design directory because they can overwrite an old
        function or a non-existent file. Then you should test the whole site functionality to search for bugs, style
        problems or themes. And the final stages are deploy to stage and deploy to production. Of course, you need to
        run all existing Autotests, Unit Tests and complete regression testing to ensure that everything went well.
