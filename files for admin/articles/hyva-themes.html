          Speed, low development cost and simplicity are all about Hyva, a new front theme for Magento 2. It appeared in
          2021 as an alternative to Luma Themes, and has already become a competitor of PWA technology. The very name of
          Hyva in translation from Finnish means desirable and expedient. We have seen in practice all the advantages of
          the new front line and share them with you.

      <p class="article__text">
        There is no business which is not interested in fast site loading. According to experts, such a giant of the
        American market as Walmart gets up to 2% increase in income per second issued during website download.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        The highest conversion rates of the site in ecommerce occur between the first and second seconds. In other
        words, if 1000 visitors of the site buy goods worth 40 USD, then in 1 second of loading of the page you get the
        income of 1 220 USD, and in two seconds 672 USD each next second reduces the conversion of your site, and
        accordingly income. In addition, the speed of website loading affects customer loyalty. Studies show that more
        than 60% of buyers who had a negative experience of waiting will never buy on this site.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        Hyva accelerates the work of the site and this is its main advantage. This is due to the fact that the
        developers have abandoned Less, Knockout, RequireJS, Jquery and other libraries that weigh tens of kilobytes.
        Only Jquery weighs 38 kb. Instead, Hyva used a single JavaScript framework, AlpineJS.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        Alpine.js version 3.10. 3 after minification takes only 13 kb. The failure to use a large number of js files has
        significantly reduced the amount of data that you need to transfer to your browser. It accelerated the site's
        work.

      <p class="article__text">
        Also, the developers added Tailwind CSS, which reduces CSS output by more than 90% compared to traditional
        methods. On Hyva projects is used only 14 kb weighing of CCS. Just to compare, the development of Luma CCS is
        about 80 kb. This "ease" is the main advantage of Hyva over the standard Magento topics because the direction
        affects the ranking of the site in the search. Sites at Hyva with the least effort get a green zone from Google
        Insights PageSpeed. The fast front has a higher conversion, accordingly.
      </p>
      <h4 class="h4 article__title">Cost of development</h4>
      <p class="article__text">
        Another advantage of Hyva is the speed of development, which directly affects the project cost. The site only in
        ten weeks is a real case of our practice. As a project manager, I see a significant difference in the speed of
        completing the same tasks on different themes. Developers learn technology quickly. Saving the time of
        development relevant development costs for ecommerce project owners.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        The rapid pace of development allows technology to compete with PWA. That is why Hyva is demanded by small and
        medium-sized businesses, which typically have a small development budget. Let's be frank, PWA technology is not
        cheap. Often companies start their history with PWA to speed up the website’s work but do not complete it since
        the budget is drawn up earlier.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        In addition, the rapid development allows the project at Hyva to enter the ecommerce market in a short time, and
        it is more likely to win the niche for competitors. Belgium and the Netherlands are among the leaders in
        applying new technology in 2022.

      <h4 class="h4 article__title">Simple</h4>
      <p class="article__text">The simplicity of development is what every developer feels working with Hyva.</p>
      <p class="article__text">
        Hyva is fully documented. In my practice, there was no case where the developer could not independently
        investigate the question or find a response to it in the documentation. Moreover, Hyva's got a big community. It
        is possible to ask a question specialist and get an answer.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        Another thing which is extremely respectful is Compat Module Tracker creation. It is a page that provides
        information on the availability of compatibility modules in real-time mode. The compatibility modules are code
        that allows the functional module to work not only on standard magento themes, but also on Hyva. These modules
        provide conversion of styles into TailwindCSS, and JavaScript with the use of RequireJS /JQuery/Knockout - on
        Alpine.js.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        The developer can go to Compat Module Tracker and see which modules are in the process of modification, can
        download ready-made compatibility modules, and does not waste time developing new ones. Someone can publish the
        Compatibility module and it will be his contribution to the program. Also, there's voting implemented on the
        page which means the most popular module will be developed first.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        The need for flexible development of compatibility modules is undoubtedly a drawback of the new technology. And
        here there is good news for developers. Currently, Hyva themes support more than 110 extensions. Major vendors
        such as Amasty, Aheadworks, Mirasvit, Magevorx and WebKrul have already made many of their extensions compatible
        with Hyvä and this is just the beginning
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        Hyva developers have also provided additional pitchers for sellers to compete with the standard front on
        Magento:
      </p>
      <ul class="article__list">
        <li class="font-regular">
          Hyva supports the use of Pagebuilder. It allows you to set up the content on the site through a graphical
          interface.
        </li>
        <li class="font-regular">
          The developers created Hyva Checkout, a module that helps ecommerce owners solve one of the most painful
          problems – failure to complete the order. The greatest discomfort the buyer feels during the disposition of
          money, so any failure in the process of registration of the goods easily will delay doubts. The Hyva checkout
          module provides customers with fast ordering. Hyva checkout is compatible with Luma-based topics.
        </li>
        <li class="font-regular">
          Today, a library of Hyva UI interfaces has been created with ready-to-use elements. However, the developers
          promise to make open access to it. This will speed up the development and allow you to compete with standard
          Magento instruments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="article__text">
        In summary, Hyva is a very good technology for medium and small businesses that does not require a large team of
        developers. It allows you to quickly start a project and quickly start working in your niche. What experts call
        time to market. E-shop less than in 3 months - this is the dynamic that the ecommerce market has been waiting
        for a long time
