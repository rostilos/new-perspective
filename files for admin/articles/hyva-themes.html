      <h2 class="h4 article__title"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">What is Hyva Magento?</span></h2>
      <p class="article__text">
        Hyvä Magento is a theme created for e-commerce sites based on the Magento platform. It was introduced as an
        alternative to traditional Magento themes, offering users a simple yet effective solution for businesses looking
        to revamp their online presence. The theme is designed to enhance the user experience, increase conversion
        rates, and drive revenue. It also helps to reduce development costs by providing modern features and tools that
        save time and money. It's a powerful technology that gives a competitive edge to the e-commerce site.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Is Hyva Headless?</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        Hyvä is a powerful e-commerce solution built on the native Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern of Adobe
        Commerce. Unlike other headless commerce solutions, which rely on API-driven technology and heavy libraries like
        RequireJS and KnockoutJS, Hyvä utilizes the lightweight AlpineJS framework. This allows for a completely
        headless yet still highly performant experience for customers. With Hyvä, users can enjoy all the features and
        functionality offered by the traditional Adobe Commerce template canvas but with greatly accelerated speeds and
        improved Magento store performance.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h4 article__title"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Speed of Hyva Magento Theme</span></h2>

      <p class="article__text">
        No business can afford to ignore the importance of a fast-loading website. According to experts, the American
        retail giant Walmart has seen a 2% increase in revenue for every second shaved off the loading time of their
        website. Such high conversion rates within e-commerce are usually observed between the 1st and 2nd second -
        meaning that if 1000 customers spend a total of $40, Walmart would make $1,220 in the first second and $672 in
        the second.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        Every subsequent second causes a decrease in conversion rate, inevitably resulting in lower revenue.
        Additionally, loading speed is directly correlated to customer loyalty; research has shown that over 60% of
        buyers who had a negative experience with site loading will not revisit the website in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        Businesses must prioritize web page speed to improve customer satisfaction and boost profitability. Website
        owners should take action by optimizing their coding, compressing images, using caching technologies, and
        upgrading hosting services.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Improve customer satisfaction with faster website speeds</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        This will help customers get a positive experience and stay loyal to the brand. Website speed is essential for
        businesses to remain competitive and thrive in the digital landscape.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        Hyvä themes have several advantages over traditional Magento 2 themes, one of the most significant being better
        store performance. This is primarily due to the frontend developers' decision to abandon using libraries such as
        Less, Knockout, RequireJS, and Jquery.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        Jquery alone weighs 38 kb which can significantly slow down site loading time. In comparison, Hyvä Themes uses
        an advanced and lightweight JavaScript framework called Alpine.js version 3.10.3 after minification which weighs
        only 13 kb, making the Magento websites faster and more efficient.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Hyvä support of modern technologies</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        Another new feature of Hyvä themes is its support for modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Web
        Components, and ES6. Hyvä has several valuable new features:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>The ability to easily create custom layouts</p></li>
        <li><p>Responsive design that works on all devices, including mobile devices</p></li>
        <li><p>Built-in support for images, videos, and other media</p></li>
        <li><p>Built-in SEO optimization tools</p></li>
        <li><p>Powerful customization options.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="article__text">
        These features make Hyvä themes also come with powerful customization options. This makes it easy to tailor the
        website's design, layout, and functionality to suit any project or business.

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Magento store performance</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        The Hyvä themes are designed to improve Magento store performance and user engagement in every way possible. One
        of the unique ways it does this is through Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for the rapid
        development of web pages. Using the Tailwind class system in the Hyvä themes allows for a drastic reduction in
        the amount of CSS output, resulting in project files that are only 14 kb in size, compared to the much larger 80
        kb of traditional theme CSS project files.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        This size reduction leads to faster loading times and improves user engagement with the website. With the Hyvä
        themes, businesses can expect a significant boost in web catalog usability and a better compatibility module
        tracker.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Hyva themes in Google Page Speed Insights</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        As a website owner or developer, ensuring your site is optimized for user experience, and search engine rankings
        are crucial. One key aspect of this optimization is website performance, which can be measured using tools like
        Google PageSpeed Insights. One way to improve your website's performance is by utilizing a CSS framework like
        Tailwind CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        The Hyvä themes use Tailwind classes, significantly improving website performance, resulting in higher scores on
        Google PageSpeed Insights and better core web vitals. A well-designed CSS framework like Tailwind CSS can
        enhance your Magento website's core web vitals and provide a better user experience for your visitors.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Magento Ecosystem</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        Ultimately, the combination of modern practices and technologies implemented on the Hyvä themes makes it one of
        the most- and time-effective solutions for any project using the Magento ecosystem. A significantly better
        performance, reduced complexity, and quick loading times make it an ideal choice for businesses looking to
        create a great user experience while increasing their online visibility.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        By using the Hyvä themes with Tailwind class, businesses can quickly and efficiently achieve better rankings in
        searches that can be kept low, as the Hyvä pieces are designed to be easy and cost-effective. Finally,
        businesses will benefit from improved user engagement with the store due to its improved loading speed.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h4 article__title"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Cost of Hyvä implementation</span></h2>

      <p class="article__text">
        The Hyvä themes offer many benefits for frontend development, one of the most notable being the ability to save
        on your license cost. Our practice has confirmed that the development time for a site using the Hyvä themes can
        be as little as ten weeks. This is a significant difference compared to other themes and can significantly
        impact the bottom line for store owners.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Hyva theme vs. PWA studio frontends</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        As a project manager, I've also observed that the learning curve for frontend developers using the Magento Hyvä
        theme is surprisingly smooth, allowing them to save time and quickly reach optimal performance metrics.
        Additionally, the theme's structure allows for efficient writing of javascript, further increasing development
        velocity and ultimately leading to significant cost savings.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        In today's fast-paced digital world, businesses must stay ahead and adopt the latest technologies to remain
        competitive.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        The development cost associated with Progressive Web App (PWA) solutions can be a barrier for many small and
        medium-sized businesses with a limited budget. That's where Hyvä comes in. As a PWA Studio frontend built on a
        PHP framework, Hyvä offers advanced features and capabilities at a fraction of the cost.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        One of the most significant advantages of using Hyvä is that it makes PWA technology accessible to businesses
        that may have been unable to afford it. Many companies have attempted to implement PWA technology in the past
        but have been forced to abandon their projects due to budget constraints. With Hyvä, businesses can now leverage
        the power of PWAs without breaking the bank.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Hyvä implementation for SMB</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        The demand for Hyvä is skyrocketing among small and medium-sized businesses looking to take their online
        presence to the next level. It is affordable for those who want to stay competitive in today's digital landscape
        without compromising performance and features. Hyvä is the perfect choice for your business if you're
        considering a new project.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        The Hyvä theme implementation is a powerful tool for businesses looking to enter the e-commerce market quickly and effectively.
        With its rapid development, the theme is designed to help companies to win market share in the highly
        competitive e-commerce space. Using the latest technology and best practices, the Hyvä theme can deliver a
        high-performing, feature-rich store that will stand out from the competition.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Integration of Hyvä themes with Magento 2</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        One of the key advantages of the Hyvä theme is its integration with Magento Community and Adobe Commerce, two of
        the most widely-used e-commerce platforms. This allows businesses to quickly and seamlessly integrate their
        store with the Magento 2 platform, taking advantage of its powerful features and capabilities.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        Furthermore, it is a perfect solution for businesses in Belgium and the Netherlands, as they are among the
        leaders in applying new technology in 2022.

        take their e-commerce efforts to the next level.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h4 article__title">
        <span style="text-transform: uppercase">The simplicity of the Magento Hyvä theme</span>
      </h2>

      <p class="article__text">
        When it comes to web development, the Hyvä theme is a game-changer. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a
        favorite among developers, who appreciate the streamlined development process that it offers.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        One of the key benefits of using Hyvä is that it makes writing javascript easier by providing a set of pre-built
        templates that can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of your project.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Hyvä documentation</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        The Hyvä theme is designed to meet the demands of modern e-commerce by providing a comprehensive and
        well-documented resource. Hyvä documentation explains the theme's features, tools, and instructions on how to
        use them. It also guides Magento 2 developers on how to customize the theme to fit the specific needs of their
        e-commerce site. Having a well-documented theme like Hyvä makes it easy for developers to understand the theme's
        capabilities and implement it effectively and efficiently, reducing the need for extensive customization and
        saving valuable time and resources.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        In my practice, I have found that the online documentation is comprehensive and easy to understand, and the
        developer community is highly active, making it easy to get answers to any questions you may have.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Hyvä community</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        The Hyvä theme is a powerful tool for developers looking to create modern and functional online stores. Its
        community is active and helpful, making the development process more efficient. The theme offers a low learning
        curve, current technologies, web catalog functionality, customizable templates, and easy style-creating options.
        The Hyvä community is always ready to help with any questions, making it an excellent option for businesses
        looking to stay competitive in the e-commerce market.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        One of the key strengths of the Hyvä community is its members' level of expertise and experience. The community
        is made up of developers, designers, and other professionals who have a deep understanding of the platform and
        the e-commerce industry as a whole. This means that when you have a question or need help, you can be sure that
        you're getting advice from someone who truly knows what they're talking about.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Hyvä tutorials</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        Another great thing about the Hyvä community is its members' level of engagement. Whether you're a beginner just
        starting with the platform or an experienced Magento 2 developer looking to take your skills to the next level,
        you'll find that the community is always willing to lend a hand.

      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Compatibility Module Tracker</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        Compatibility Module Tracker is a powerful tool that provides real-time information on the availability of
        compatibility modules, specifically designed to work seamlessly with the popular Hyvä themes and the default
        theme of Magento 2.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        The Compatibility Module Tracker is an essential tool for Magento developers looking to enhance their e-commerce
        websites with new themes and layouts. The modules convert traditional styles into the highly popular Tailwind
        CSS and JavaScript using modern frameworks such as RequireJS, JQuery, Knockout, and Alpine.js. This ensures that
        the functional modules are compatible with the latest design trends and technologies.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        With the Compatibility Module Tracker, developers can easily track the status of compatibility modules, download
        ready-made modules, and even contribute their modules to the program. The page also features a voting system,
        allowing developers to prioritize the development of the most popular modules.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        The Compatibility Module Tracker is also integrated into the admin panel, allowing easy access and management.
        This ensures that developers can easily keep their website up-to-date with the latest templates and layouts
        without wasting valuable time and resources.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Hyvä extensions</h3>

      <p class="article__text">
        One of the standout features of Hyvä is its extensive support for extensions. Currently, the Hyvä theme supports
        over 110 extensions from major vendors such as Amasty, Aheadworks, Mirasvit, Magevorx, and WebKrul. This means
        that many popular extension providers have already made their modules compatible with Hyvä, and this number will
        surely grow.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        Hyvä theme developers have also provided additional pitchers for sellers to compete with the standard front on
        Magento:
      </p>

      <h4 class="h4 article__title-bold">Pagebuilder</h4>
      <p class="article__text">
        One of the critical features supported by Hyvä is a <b>Pagebuilder</b>. This powerful Magento 2 tool allows
        merchants to quickly set up and organize the content on their website through a user-friendly graphical
        interface. With Pagebuilder, merchants can create custom layouts, add and edit content blocks, and preview
        changes in real time. This feature provides a high degree of flexibility and control over the design and layout
        of a website, enabling merchants to create a unique and engaging user experience. Furthermore, it is easy to use
        and doesn't require coding skills, making it accessible to users of all levels.
      </p>

      <h4 class="h4 article__title-bold">Hyvä Checkout</h4>
      <p class="article__text">
        The developers created <b>Hyvä Checkout</b>, designed to help online store owners improve the checkout
        experience for their customers. The module addresses the common problem of abandoned carts by providing a fast
        and streamlined checkout process, reducing the likelihood of customers dropping off during the payment process.
        The module is designed with the customer in mind to make the transaction as smooth and efficient as possible. It
        is compatible with the default Luma theme, which seamlessly integrates with your website design, allowing
        customers to have a consistent shopping experience. Additionally, the Hyvä Checkout module is designed to be
        user-friendly and intuitive to navigate, which helps to reduce customer frustration and increase the chances of
        a successful transaction.
      </p>

      <h4 class="h4 article__title-bold">Hyvä UI Library</h4>
      <p class="article__text">
        One of the standout features of Hyvä is its extensive <b>library of UI interfaces</b>, which includes a wide
        range of ready-to-use elements that can be easily implemented into a store. These elements include buttons,
        forms, icons, and more and are designed to be fully customizable to match the specific needs of a merchant's
        website. This library of UI elements is intended to save developers time and effort by providing pre-built
        components that can be easily integrated into a website without requiring extensive coding or development.
        Furthermore, the developers of Hyvä have promised to make open access to this library, which means that
        developers will have access to the same elements and functionality as the Hyvä team. This allows merchants to
        compete with standard Magento modules and create a unique and tailored user experience. The Hyvä UI components
        are fully functional and ready for implementation. They are comprised of PHTML templates that can easily be
        integrated into your project by simply copying and pasting the provided code.
