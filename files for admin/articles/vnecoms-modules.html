          Perspective team has been working on a fashion marketplace on the VnEcoms extensions for a long time. The
          project covers all stages of development, from UI/UX design to QA and testing. Today it is already in
          pre-deployment condition. So we have a lot to talk about and are happy to share.

      <p class="_text-article">
        Often, the Magento platform is associated with the development of online stores only. However, it allows
        businesses to scale up to the multi-vendor marketplace. The following components of the marketplace system are
        Merchant Administration System, Product Information Management, Order Management System, Billings,
        Reporting&Analytics.

        During the development of the fashion marketplace, we applied a group of extensions from VnEcoms. However, the
        extensions only cover some customer needs, which is a usual practice. After all, every business has its
        peculiarities. The customization has been subject to many processes, and we would like to tell you more about
        them.
      </p>

      <h4 class="h4 article__title">What has been processed and why?</h4>
      <ol class="article__list article__list--num _list-numbered">
        <!-- 1 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            Firstly, we have simplified the process of seller registration. We built the logic of the seller filling in
            a form on the page of the marketplace:
          </p>
          <div class="article__image article__image--narrow">
            <img
              itemprop="image"
              loading="lazy"
              src="{{media url='wysiwyg/articles/vnecoms/3.png'}}"
              alt="Screenshot with an example of a seller registration form"
            />
          </div>
          <p class="_text-article">
            The data from the form gets into the administrative panel. The main admin receives notifications to the
            e-mail address and on the admin panel about a new request and confirms it.
          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- 2 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            Registration of the order was automatized. How it looks: the seller presses the eccept button when receiving
            the order and automatically creates an invoice, shipment, and the delivery of waybills. Also added an
            opportunity to edit the order.
          </p>
        </li>
        <!-- 3 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            The management of orders was modified. Below you can see the view of the personal account before and after
            modification. Orders are distributed according to the status: new, processing, combined or canceled. For a
            seller, it is way more convenient to track the order.
          </p>

          <div class="article__image article__image--narrow">
            <img

        <!-- 4 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            The Vendor RMA from VnEcoms was modified to meet the client's needs. Previously, its function allowed a
            return from only one seller at a time. We have created a logic so that you can choose products from any
            seller when returning. It became more accessible for the buyer to manage the registration and return
            process.
          </p>
        </li>
        <!-- 5 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            Another case is the development of the delivery function. It's a separate story. Since it was an
            international multi-vendor marketplace, the owner chose DHL as the logistics operator for order delivery.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            The Magento platform has a module for the DHL delivery method but not for the marketplace. VnEcoms also has
            it. However, it is designed to work for one seller, so that is one DHL account. Both options did not solve
            the technical task. As a result, we have redesigned the module provided by VnEcoms to work with one account.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            During the process, there was a problem with the correctness of ratings (UK presence). As it turned out, DHL
            API did not consider the Brexit fee then. After that, we finalized the functionality. Also, a function was
            developed for reserving the address ban of shipments.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            Now it looks like this. The seller gets a new order and clicks accept, then automatically creates an
            invoice, shipment with the generation of packages and receiving shipping labels, and a tracking number from
            DHL. The order status changes to processing. Once the invoice is created, the DHL Address Ban button is
            available.
          </p>
          <div class="article__image article__image--narrow">
            <img
              itemprop="image"
              loading="lazy"
              src="{{media url='wysiwyg/articles/vnecoms/6.png'}}"
              alt="Screenshot from Vnecoms Marketplace account page, order details"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="article__image article__image--narrow">
            <img
              itemprop="image"
              loading="lazy"

              alt="Screenshot from Vnecoms Marketplace account page, order details"
            />
          </div>
          <p class="_text-article">
            Additionally, a feature has been developed that sends requests to the DHL API twice daily on cron and checks
            the post statuses. If it's delivered, then the order is considered final, and only after that can the seller
            make a return. The buyer can also monitor the order's status through the tracking number in his account.
            This mechanism has been used to ensure that the tracking number is automatically displayed on the DHL page.
          </p>
        </li>
        <!-- 6 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            In this case, we had to realize a highly complex pricing logic. We have developed a price-setting module
            specifically for the client's technical task. It was essential to keep the primary function of Magento.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            The first thing that complicates the pricing mechanism is the marketplace's geography. It has different
            stores depending on the buyer's region: UK, USA, EU, GLOBAL. Accordingly, for other buyers, there are
            various taxes, additional costs of delivery, and so on. In general, the charge is calculated taking into
            account six indicators. That is why the same goods in different stores can be fundamentally different in
            meaning of price.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            We have created the function so that the seller in his office displays the cost of the goods. The final cost
            considers all the indicators and is calculated automatically for each store. On the site, the buyer sees the
            final cost of the product, formed according to the pricing logic.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            The seller has retained all basic marketing logic (special price, group price, and tier price) at the level
            of the page, and the store owner can manage the catalog price. .
          </p>
        </li>
        <!-- 7 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            For transactions on the site, use the payment service Stripe. It is customized accordingly to business
            needs. When creating or supporting regular online stores, meeting such a function as the division of payment
            between several participants was not necessary. In this case, we met a task that says the full payment does
            not fall on account of the market's owner but only the commission.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            VnEcoms has a module for Stripe, but it did not cover our needs. Thanks to the modification, the module
            removes funds from the bank card and assigns the accounts to the owner of the business and the seller of
            goods. The market owner is given a сommission, the spent parts, and the delivery cost. The seller receives
            at the expense of the product sum, which was made at its creation, with the deduction of the basic
            commission.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4 class="h4 article__title">Modules from other vendors</h4>
      <p class="_text-article">
        In addition to VnEcoms modules, more than a dozen other vendor modules were used to cover the customer's needs.
        Some of them we've installed without changes, and others are customized:
