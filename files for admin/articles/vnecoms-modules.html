          Perspective Studio team has been working on a fashion marketplace on the VnEcoms modules for a long time. The
          project covers all stages of development, from UI/UX design to QA and testing. Today it is already in
          pre-deployment condition. So we have a lot to talk about and are happy to share.

      <h4 class="article__title">What does the fashion marketplace based on Magento 2 look like?</h4>
      <p class="article__text">
        Often, the Magento platform is associated with the development of online stores. Nevertheless it allows
        businesses to scale up to the multi vendor marketplace. The following components of the marketplace system are
        Merchant Administration System, Product Information Management, Order Management System, Billings,
        Reporting&Analytics.
      </p>

        During the development of fashion marketplace, we applied a group of modules from VnEcoms. However, the modules
        do not cover all customer needs, which is a normal practice. After all, every business has its peculiarities.
        The customization has been subject to many processes and we would like to tell more about them.
      </p>

      <h4 class="article__title">What has been processed and why?</h4>
      <ol class="article__list article__list--num _list-numbered">
        <!-- 1 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            Firstly, we have simplified the process of seller registration. The following logic was laid, there is a
            form filled in by the seller on the page of the marketplace:
          </p>
          <div class="article__image article__image--narrow">
            <img loading="lazy" src="{{media url='wysiwyg/articles/vnecoms/3.png'}}" alt="image-1" />
          </div>
          <p class="article__text">
            The data from the form gets into the administrative panel. The main admin receives notifications to the
            e-mail address as well as on the admin panel about a new request and confirm it.
          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- 2 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            Registration of the order was automatized. How it looks: the seller presses the eccept button when receiving
            the order and automatically creates an invoice, shipment, and the delivery of waybills. Also added an
            opportunity to edit the order.
          </p>
        </li>
        <!-- 3 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            The management of orders was modified. Below you can see the view of the personal account before and after
            modification. Orders are distributed according to the status: new, processing, combined, cancelled. For a
            seller, it is way more convenient to track the order.
          </p>
          
          <div class="article__image article__image--narrow">
            <img loading="lazy" src="{{media url='wysiwyg/articles/vnecoms/4.png'}}" alt="image-1" />
          </div>
          <div class="article__image article__image--narrow">
            <img loading="lazy" src="{{media url='wysiwyg/articles/vnecoms/5.png'}}" alt="image-1" />
          </div>
        </li>

        <!-- 4 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            The Vendor RMA from VnEcoms was modified to meet the needs of the client. Previously, his function allowed
            making a return from only one seller at a time. We have created a logic so that when returning, you can
            choose products of any seller. It became easier for the buyer to manage the process of registration and
            returning goods.
          </p>
        </li>
        <!-- 5 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            Another case is the development of the delivery function. It's a separate story. Since it was international
            multi vendor marketplace, the owner has chosen DHL as the logistics operator for order delivery.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            In the Magento platform there is a module for the DHL delivery method, but not for the marketplace, VnEcoms
            also has it, however it is designed to work for one seller, so that is one DHL account. Both options did not
            solve the technical task. As a result, we have redesigned the module provided by VnEcoms to work with one
            account.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            During the process, there was a problem with the correctness of ratings (UK presence). As it turned out, at
            that time DHL API did not take into account the Brexit fee. After that, we finalized the functionality.
            Also, a function for reservation of the address ban of shipments was developed.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            Now it looks like this. The seller gets a new order and clicks accept, then automatically creates an
            invoice, shipment with the generation of packages and receiving shipping labels, and a tracking number from
            DHL. The order status changes to processing. Once the invoice is created, the DHL Address Ban button is
            available.
          </p>
          <div class="article__image article__image--narrow">
            <img loading="lazy" src="{{media url='wysiwyg/articles/vnecoms/6.png'}}" alt="image-1" />
          </div>
          <div class="article__image article__image--narrow">
            <img loading="lazy" src="{{media url='wysiwyg/articles/vnecoms/7.png'}}" alt="image-1" />
          </div>
          <p class="article__text">
            Additionally, a feature has been developed that sends requests to the DHL API twice a day on cron and checks
            the post statuses. If it's delivered, then the order is considered final and only after that, the seller can
            make a return. The buyer can also monitor the status of the order through the tracking number in his
            personal account. This mechanism has been used to ensure that the tracking number is automatically displayed
            on the DHL page.
          </p>
        </li>
        <!-- 6 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            In this case we had to realize a very difficult logic of pricing. We have developed a price-setting module
            specifically for the client's technical task. It was important not to break the basic function of Magento.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            The first thing that complicated the mechanism of pricing is the geography of marketplace. It has different
            stores depending on the buyer's region: UK, USA, EU, GLOBAL. Accordingly, for different buyers, there are
            different taxes, different costs of delivery and so on. In general, the cost is calculated taking into
            account six indicators. That is why the same goods in different stores can be fundamentally different in
            meaning of price.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            We have created the function in such a way that the seller in his office displays the cost of the goods, and
            the final cost takes into account all the indicators and is calculated automatically for each store
            individually. On the site, the buyer sees the final cost of the product, which is formed according to the
            logic of pricing.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            The seller has retained all basic marketing logic (special price, group price and tier price) at the level
            of the page, and the store owner can manage catalogue price.
          </p>
        </li>
        <!-- 7 -->
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            For transactions on the site used the payment service Stripe, it is customized accordingly to business
            needs. When creating or supporting regular online stores, it was not necessary to meet such a function as
            the division of payment between several participants. In this case, we met a task that says the whole
            payment does not fall on the account of the owner of the market, but only the commission.
          </p>
          <p class="_list-numbered__text">
            VnEcoms has a module for Stripe, but it did not cover our needs. Thanks to the modification, the module
            removes funds from the bank card and assigns the accounts to the owner of the business and the seller of
            goods. The owner of the market is given a —Åommission and the spent parts as well as the cost of delivery.
            The seller receives at the expense of the product sum, which was made at its creation, with the deduction of
            the basic commission.
          </p>

      </ol>

      <h4 class="article__title">Modules from other vendors</h4>
      <p class="article__text">
        In addition to VnEcoms modules, more than a dozen other vendor modules were used to cover the customer's needs.
        Some of them we've installed without changes, and other are customised:
