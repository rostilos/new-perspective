          Magento Contribution Day is an influential gathering within the Magento community that draws together a
          devoted assembly of Magento enthusiasts. Its primary aim is to rally as many developers as possible to
          contribute to the platform's evolution. Surprisingly, nearly 80% of all modifications to the Magento code have
          been incorporated due to individual and team contributions made during these auspicious events.

        Our company, Perspective, was eager to participate in this initiative. During our first involvement, nine
        developers devoted an entire day to tackling issues plaguing the previous version of M2. With each participant
        handling two or three tasks, the Perspective team resolved ten significant challenges and assembled 1477 lines
        of remedied code. Most of the tasks carried high priority levels of P1 and P2, indicating urgent resolution was
        needed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="h4">
        Indeed, the participation of Perspective in Magento Contribution Day isn't just about making meaningful
        contributions to the platform. It's also a testament to our dedication to achieving excellence in the digital
        solutions industry. This commitment hasn't gone unnoticed. In a gratifying testament to our hard work and
        innovative contributions, Perspective has been recognized as one of the Top-5 Partner Contributors to Adobe
        Commerce. This recognition underlines our steadfast dedication to improving and delivering advanced digital
        solutions, reaffirming our standing as leaders in the Magento community. With such high recognition, we approach
        every Contribution Day with an unwavering commitment to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible with
        Magento. Now, let's delve into the advantages of participating in Magento Contribution Day.

            Working with the maintainers and Magento core architects would give us unique insights into the platform and
            allow us to contribute to its development. By becoming part of Magento history, our team can enhance our
            code awareness and better understand the platform's capabilities. Working with the maintainers could lead to
            more options for our clients and a more substantial reputation in the industry.

            We are improving the company's image within the community of the Magento development team. Earning a
            contributor mark for a company on GitHub is incredible for the team. Contributing to an open-source project
            goes from an active GitHub account desire. It helps improve the company's image within the community and
            shows that the team is actively involved in open-source development.

        You'll be able to work with other professionals and learn from their approaches and techniques to help you
        refine your workflow and become more efficient in your development process. It's a win-win situation - you get

      <p class="article__text _text-article--sm">
        A new column, "good first issue," appears on the GitHub "board" during Contribution Day. Practical tasks are
        snapped up, but you can remove some from the High Priority issue column, just like we did. These high-priority
        issues involved developing features we use almost daily at work. We understood that solving the chosen tasks
        would provide a new perspective on M2 development.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text _text-article--sm">
        When choosing a task, there may be a situation like this: pull request may be "empty." That is, somewhere, there
        is a clone of the problem with almost the same description, and ANOTHER developer (because it can be added as a
        person working with the company as a solo developer) described his decision to the letter (only "gaps" in
        different places), and it coincided. The version control system automatically shows no differences.

            After completing the task, we encountered high standards of code acceptance. The "quality" of the code is
            checked in the first place by the machine with a set of rules. An interesting nuance is that the developer
            should write an autotest if this area code is new or not covered with tests. It's essential to do code
            reviews to have better code awareness. Writing autotests for new or untested code areas can also ensure
            high-quality work. According to the standards, there were almost no problems because the quality of the code
            was good.

        There was a different situation with autotests; we thought we messed things up when we wrote, launched, and ran
        them. That is just because the tests broke in random places; even in those, we did not change anything. As it
        turned out, the collapse of some tests is typical for such an important mechanism as M2.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text _text-article--sm">
        On the last Contribution day, we tended to take in the tasks on M2 fixation under the hood to avoid writing
        functional tests (i.e., the visual part). By then, we wanted to avoid playing around with the settings and
        WebDriver for Google Chrome. Besides that, we wanted to get away from Luma, the original M2 Theme. We understood
        that it would be deprecated in the nearest future little by little, which happened! Adobe released PWA studio.
        The Venia Theme and those more likely to choose the traditional approach decided to develop what is now called
        Hyva.

        Further verification of the task is done by the Magento development team from the Adobe/Magento side, and the QA
        team plays the last, but not the least, role in this stage.

        The Magento core community engineering team works diligently, which sometimes means our tasks may linger for a
        few months with green ticks awaiting to be merged into the main branch. Nonetheless, each task resolution is a
        cause for celebration, often marked with a festive pizza party at our office. The process becomes more dynamic
        as we gain more experience and improve our skills. Feedback from the Magento community engineering team arrives
        more promptly, and our pull requests are merged faster. In recognition of our contributions, we've even earned a
        Partner label on Github, demonstrating our expertise in Magento core and credibility in the industry.
