          Magento Contribution Day is an important event for the Magento community and its dedicated group of Magento
          enthusiasts. Its goal is to unite as many developers as possible to contribute to the platform's development.
          Almost 80% of all changes to the Magento code were added thanks to the personal and team contributions made
          during these events.

        Our company has also joined this initiative. In 2022, 9 developers took part in Magento Contribution Day. They
        devoted a whole day to solving problems, which were super annoying from the previous version of M2. There were 2
        or 3 tasks (pull requests) per person. As a result, the Perspective team has found a solution for ten tasks and
        put together 1477 lines of fixed code. Most tasks have a priority level of P1 and P2, meaning they need a
        solution as soon as possible.

            Working with the maintainers and Magento core architects would give us unique insights into the platform and
            allow us to contribute to its development. By becoming part of Magento history, our team can enhance our
            code awareness and better understand the platform's capabilities. Working with the maintainers could lead to
            more options for our clients and a more substantial reputation in the industry.

            We are improving the company's image within the community of the Magento development team. Earning a
            contributor mark for a company on GitHub is incredible for the team. Contributing to an open-source project
            goes from an active GitHub account desire. It helps improve the company's image within the community and
            shows that the team is actively involved in open-source development.

        You'll be able to work with other professionals and learn from their approaches and techniques to help you
        refine your workflow and become more efficient in your development process. It's a win-win situation - you get

      <p class="article__text _text-article--sm">
        A new column, "good first issue," appears on the GitHub "board" during Contribution Day. Practical tasks are
        snapped up, but you can remove some from the High Priority issue column, just like we did. These high-priority
        issues involved developing features we use almost daily at work. We understood that solving the chosen tasks
        would provide a new perspective on M2 development.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text _text-article--sm">
        When choosing a task, there may be a situation like this: pull request may be "empty." That is, somewhere, there
        is a clone of the problem with almost the same description, and ANOTHER developer (because it can be added as a
        person working with the company as a solo developer) described his decision to the letter (only "gaps" in
        different places), and it coincided. The version control system automatically shows no differences.

            After completing the task, we encountered high standards of code acceptance. The "quality" of the code is
            checked in the first place by the machine with a set of rules. An interesting nuance is that the developer
            should write an autotest if this area code is new or not covered with tests. It's essential to do code
            reviews to have better code awareness. Writing autotests for new or untested code areas can also ensure
            high-quality work. According to the standards, there were almost no problems because the quality of the code
            was good.

        There was a different situation with autotests; we thought we messed things up when we wrote, launched, and ran
        them. That is just because the tests broke in random places; even in those, we did not change anything. As it
        turned out, the collapse of some tests is typical for such an important mechanism as M2.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text _text-article--sm">
        On the last Contribution day, we tended to take in the tasks on M2 fixation under the hood to avoid writing
        functional tests (i.e., the visual part). By then, we wanted to avoid playing around with the settings and
        WebDriver for Google Chrome. Besides that, we wanted to get away from Luma, the original M2 Theme. We understood
        that it would be deprecated in the nearest future little by little, which happened! Adobe released PWA studio.
        The Venia Theme and those more likely to choose the traditional approach decided to develop what is now called
        Hyva.

        Further verification of the task is done by the Magento development team from the Adobe/Magento side, and the QA
        team plays the last, but not the least, role in this stage.

        When Magento makes PDF invoices for the administrator, it works according to the mechanisms built into the PHP
        programming language. And when this language was created, it did not count on the network data storage device
        name, so it became an obstacle in creating PDF invoices.

        The Magento core community engineering team did a lot of work, so our tasks hovered for 2 or 3 months with green
        ticks. All that remained was to merge them into the main branch. After one of the task developers had a request
        accepted, we ordered pizza to celebrate at our office location. Next, Magento Contribution Day was more dynamic
        from the Adobe side. Already a week later, we had feedback from the Magento community engineering team, two of
        our pool requests were merged, and we were also given a Partner label on Github=)), Partner label on GitHub is
        not only adorable but can also be a valuable business asset as it demonstrates expertise in Magento core and
        credibility in the industry.

      <p class="_text-article--sm article__text">
        The Magento Contribution Day is an excellent opportunity for developers to contribute to the Magento community
        and a measure of success. The fact that the developers have a lot of work and find time to take pull requests
        shows how dedicated they are to improving the platform. This level of commitment can only lead to better
        business outcomes for both Adobe and its partners.
