            Take some time to review competitors, try out different themes on your Magento platform and tweak to give an

        Once your brand design is finalized, you should think of sending the finalized layouts to a developer. The

        your eCommerce store.
      </p>

      <p class="article__text">
        When the developer finishes with the technical aspects, you should think of cataloguing your product/services.

            pictures, SEO, URLs, etc. from a single file. You will have to prepare a CSV file for data import and upload
            it on the platform.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            Ready-made APIs: You can also create products on the platform in real time by defining all the attributes
            and making it live on your platform.
