          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">
            It is better to write CSS rules in modules (blocks) so that the stylization of some selectors does not stop
            others. Also, we recommend avoiding making a long chain of selectors. All CSS files, or libraries to be
            tested, should be stored locally, not downloaded via CDN.

      <h2 class="h4 article__title">What is Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</h2>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        <strong class="font-bold">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</strong> is a crucial visual stability metric that
        quantifies the extent of unexpected layout shifts during page load. It is measured by the sum of all layout
        shift scores that exceed a threshold of 0.1. Improving CLS has become a top priority for businesses as user
        experience takes center stage in modern web development. Therefore, it is no surprise that clients frequently
        request improvements to this key performance indicator.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">What are the most common causes of poor Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</h3>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        Visual stability indicators are critical for ensuring a smooth and seamless user experience. However, poor
        visual stability can be caused by several technical factors. Some common culprits include the sizing of image
        and multimedia files, GraphQL queries, and unoptimized carousels.
      </p>

      <h4 class="_text-article font-semibold">INCORRECT SIZING OF IMAGE AND MULTIMEDIA FILES</h4>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        When images or multimedia files do not have a specified size, the browser cannot allocate the appropriate amount
        of space when the item is loaded. This can result in a page layout that is constantly shifting, causing a poor
        user experience.
      </p>

      <h4 class="_text-article font-semibold">UNOPTIMIZED GRAPHQL QUERIES</h4>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        When loading images or GraphQL blocks on a Progressive Web App (PWA), failing to reserve space can cause the
        page to "jump" after loading. This can lead to poor layout shifts and negatively impact performance metrics.
      </p>

      <h4 class="_text-article font-semibold">UNOPTIMIZED CAROUSELS</h4>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        An unoptimized carousel that uses non-smooth and non-combined animations can trigger a re-calculation of the
        page layout, resulting in poor Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) scores. While a slight shift may be barely
        noticeable to the user, it can significantly impact the page's overall layout change and visual stability.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">How to improve visual stability indicator and Cumulative Layout Shift</h3>

      <h4 class="_text-article font-semibold">USING PLACEHOLDERS</h4>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        Implementing placeholders is a widely adopted technique to improve the perceived performance of a website.
        Placeholders serve as visual cues that indicate that the download is in progress and the site is functioning
        correctly. The most effective approach for images is setting the height and width attributes.
      </p>
      <figure style="margin-bottom: 24px">

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        This strategy lets the browser reserve the necessary space for images before fully loading, preventing
        unexpected layout shifts. Here is an example of implementing this technique using the
        <b class="font-bold">img</b> tag.
      </p>
      <div class="_code-string flex">
        <div
          class="_code-string_num flex _text-article _text-article--sm"
          style="

            min-width: 32px;
            border-radius: 5px 0px 0px 5px;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
          "
        >
          1
        </div>
        <div
          class="_code-string__content _text-article _text-article--sm"
          style="
            padding: 8px 16px;
            background: #f9f9f9;
            height: 100%;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            flex-grow: 1;
          "
        >
          &lt;img data-src="image.webp" width="380" height="120" alt="image"&gt;
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        By defining the height and width attributes, the browser can allocate space for the image and prevent the layout
        from shifting when the image loads. As a result, users will experience a smoother and more visually stable
        browsing experience.
      </p>

      <h4 class="_text-article font-semibold">FONT-DISPLAY: SWAP</h4>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        To achieve the optimal Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) score, developers can utilize the
        <b class="font-bold">font-display: swap</b>
        property to display text in the system font before the custom font file has fully loaded. The font-face rule in
        the required CSS font file should specify the font file paths and include the
        <b class="font-bold">font-display: swap</b> property.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        Here is an example of how to define the font-face rule with the font-display: swap property:
      </p>
      <div class="_code-string flex">
        <div
          class="_code-string_num flex _text-article _text-article--sm"

            min-width: 32px;
            border-radius: 5px 0px 0px 5px;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
          "
        >
          1
        </div>
        <div
          class="_code-string__content _text-article _text-article--sm"
          style="
            padding: 8px 16px;
            background: #f9f9f9;
            height: 100%;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            flex-grow: 1;
          "
        >
          @font-face {Font-family: "Proxima Nova";src: url("../fonts/proximanova-regular.woff2")
          format("woff2");font-display: swap;}
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        Using the <b class="font-bold">font-display: swap</b> property, the browser will immediately display text in the
        system font until the custom font file is fully loaded. This technique can prevent unexpected layout shifts and
        improve the visual stability of the page, resulting in a better user experience.
      </p>

      <h4 class="_text-article font-semibold">CSS TRANSFORM</h4>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        The CSS transform feature is an influential tool developers can utilize to enhance their site's performance and
        user experience. For example, using CSS transform can help to mitigate issues related to loading image
        carousels, resulting in a faster and more user-friendly browsing experience.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        When optimizing the loading of CMS blocks (especially on PWA projects) via GraphQL HTML elements, setting CSS
        properties with a fixed height is recommended. This approach can help to prevent unexpected layout shifts and
        ensure a visually stable page after it loads.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        By implementing these techniques, businesses can improve the Core Web Vitals score and provide a smoother, more
        enjoyable user experience. In one of our recent cases, we significantly improved the CLS score by adding the
        font-display: swap property in the CSS file, setting a minimum height, and optimizing font loading (@font-face).

      <h2 class="h4 article__title">What is the First Input Delay (FID)?</h2>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        First Input Delay (FID) is a critical metric that measures a website's interactivity. First Input Delay measures
        how long a site takes to respond to a user's first interaction with a page, such as clicking a button or typing
        in a form field.
      </p>
      <h3 class="_text-article font-semibold">Using FID in Magento 2</h3>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        In Magento 2, many user interactions can affect the site's FID, such as clicking on a live chat button, adding a
        product to the basket, or completing a purchase. If these interactions are not responsive and do not provide
        immediate feedback to the user, it can result in a slow and frustrating user experience.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        To ensure optimal user experience, it is essential to achieve an FID score that is less than 100ms. This can be
        achieved through various optimization techniques, such as minimizing JavaScript execution time, optimizing
        third-party scripts, and optimizing server response time. By optimizing FID, businesses can provide a more
        responsive and engaging website that keeps users engaged and satisfied.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">How to optimize First Input Delay</h3>
      <h4 class="_text-article font-semibold">TASK DECOMPOSITION</h4>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        A recommended approach to enhance First Input Delay (FID) is partitioning lengthier tasks into smaller, more
        manageable sub-tasks. Lengthy tasks can overburden the primary thread, obstructing the processing and execution
        of user input. Any code segment that impedes the flow for more than 50 milliseconds qualifies as a lengthy task.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        Ascertaining FID necessitates conducting measurements under real-world conditions, as genuine user interaction
        with the web page is essential for obtaining precise measurements.
      </p>

      <h4 class="_text-article font-semibold">TEST IN REAL_LIFE CONDITIONS</h4>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        To accurately measure First Input Delay (FID), it is recommended to employ specialized tools that gauge
        performance under real-world conditions. A few such tools include:
      </p>
      <ol class="article__list article__list--num _list-numbered">
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">PageSpeed Insights Test</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">Search Console (Core Web Vitals report)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="_list-numbered__legend font-regular">Chrome User experience Report.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        Since FID necessitates user interaction, conducting tests in a laboratory setting is not feasible. In contrast,
        field metrics capture real-world performance by analyzing user behavior. However, the Total Blocking Time (TBT),
        a metric that assesses the period between the First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI), can be
        measured in a laboratory setting and is well correlated with FID in field conditions. TBT is also adept at
        identifying interactivity-related problems. Consequently, any optimization that enhances TBT in a laboratory
        environment will also improve FID for users. Lighthouse is a tool that can measure TBT effectively.
      </p>

      <h4 class="_text-article font-semibold">ENABLE DOWNLOAD ON DEMAND</h4>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        You can use third-party code to enable download on demand for web pages. For example, you can enable download on
        demand so that the banner at the bottom of the page or ad is displayed only when they scroll close to the view.
        The main idea is to download Web elements that provide the most significant value to users, not those that can
        be downloaded at the end of the line, as a priority.
      </p>

      <h4 class="_text-article font-semibold">OPTIMIZE JAVASCRIPT</h4>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        To enhance website performance, it is crucial to eliminate any unnecessary JavaScript files. One recommended
        approach is to defer the download of JavaScript files until they are required. This technique initially enables
        the browser to obtain critical web elements such as HTML and CSS. Following this, the scripts can be evaluated,
        thus facilitating a faster loading time.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        Adopting this strategy is especially useful for websites with substantial JavaScript extensions, such as the
        Mega Menu extension utilized by many Magento stores. This technique allows website owners to streamline the
        loading process and provide a more efficient user experience. Therefore, removing unused JavaScript is a
        fundamental optimization technique that should be considered to boost website performance.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h4 article__title">More indicators to improve Core Web Vitals</h2>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        In addition to the three main core web vitals above, several supplemental metrics exist.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">First Contentful Paint (FCP)</h3>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        First Contentful Paint (FCP) is a valuable metric that helps measure the time taken for a page to display its
        initial image or text block. This metric includes the processing time for DNS requests, server requests,
        server-side operations, and DOM primary rendering.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        While factors like DNS and network speed are beyond our control, reducing the processing time for server-side
        tasks and optimizing the loading of styles and scripts can significantly impact performance. Specifically,
        Google recommends prioritizing the inclusion of only critical styles in the head section of the webpage and, if
        possible, using style tags instead of link tags to minimize unnecessary server requests.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        To further enhance website performance, Google Analytics provides a wealth of information on user behavior and
        engagement. For instance, by using the User Timings report, website owners can monitor the duration of specific
        actions and events, including page loads, user interactions, and other custom events. This data can help
        identify areas of the website that require optimization and track the effectiveness of any changes made.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Speed Index Metric</h3>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        While FCP measures the time for the first element to display, the Speed Index (SI) metric captures the overall
        loading speed of web pages by considering the time required for the page to become fully visible to the user. It
        provides a comprehensive overview of the page load performance and considers the effects of network speed and
        server processing time. By leveraging a combination of FCP and SI, site owners can obtain a comprehensive
        overview of website performance and take appropriate steps to enhance user experience.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        SI considers various factors that impact webpage performance, including network speed, server processing time,
        and the size of resources being loaded. The metric calculates the visual completeness of a webpage at regular
        intervals during the loading process and assigns a score representing the page speed. The lower the SI score,
        the faster the page loads and the better the user experience.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        To improve SI, web developers can use a variety of optimization techniques, including minimizing external
        resources such as CSS and JavaScript, reducing image sizes, and leveraging browser caching to speed up the
        loading of resources. By analyzing SI scores with tools like Google Analytics and WebPageTest, website owners
        can identify areas that require optimization and make changes to improve website performance. Ultimately, by
        improving website performance and enhancing user experience, website owners can improve engagement, increase
        conversions, and grow their businesses.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Interaction to Next Paint</h3>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a critical metric that measures the time between a user's interaction with
        the webpage and the display of a visual response. This metric is particularly relevant for pages that require
        frequent user interactions, such as social media platforms and e-commerce sites. INP provides valuable insights
        into the responsiveness of a webpage and helps identify areas that require optimization to improve user
        experience.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        INP is calculated by selecting the most recent user interaction during the current webpage visit and measuring
        the time taken for the webpage to respond with a visual update. This update can include various changes, such as
        the appearance of a new image or text block, an element's position or size adjustment, or the execution of a
        complex animation. By measuring the time between user interaction and visual response, INP can provide valuable
        insights into the perceived performance of a webpage and help identify areas that require optimization.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        To improve INP, web developers can implement a range of optimization techniques, such as minimizing the use of
        JavaScript and reducing the size of images and videos. Additionally, utilizing modern web technologies such as
        the Intersection Observer API and Web Workers can help improve performance by offloading resource-intensive
        tasks and reducing the workload on the main thread.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 article__title">Time to First Bite (TTFB)</h3>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        Time to First Byte (TTFB) is a crucial metric for page performance. It represents the time the server takes to
        receive the first byte of data after a request has been sent. The TTFB value is influenced by various factors,
        such as network latency, server processing time, and the complexity of the website's code. A lower TTFB value is
        desirable as it indicates faster loading times and a better user experience. The ideal response time for a
        website is between 250 to 350 milliseconds, while anything above 500 is considered a long response time and can
        negatively impact the website's performance.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        To improve TTFB values, website owners can use various tools and techniques. One such technique is query
        caching, storing frequently accessed data in a cache, allowing faster access and retrieval. Tools like Varnish
        can act as a caching layer between the server and the user, improving website speed and reducing server load.
        For PWA projects, service workers can be used to cache HTML content, which can be updated when the content
        changes, providing faster access to frequently accessed content.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        For Magento projects, full-page caching can also improve TTFB values. Full-page caching allows the entire page
        to be cached, reducing the need for the server to run a lot of code and retrieve information from the database.
        With full-page caching enabled, the browser can read the page directly from the cache, leading to faster loading
        times and improved user experience.
      </p>
      <p class="_text-article _text-article--sm">
        Therefore, you should not make as many pages and blocks but reduce them as possible.
      </p>
