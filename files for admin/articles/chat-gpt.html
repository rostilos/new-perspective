        To use ChatGPT for answering repetitive customer service inquiries, you will first need to gather and prepare
        your customer service dataset. This
        <a href="https://www.apizee.com/chatgpt-customer-service/" class="_text-orange">should include</a> a large
        dataset of customer service interactions such as chat logs, email exchanges, and video and phone transcripts.
